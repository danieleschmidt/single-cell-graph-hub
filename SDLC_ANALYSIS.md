# SDLC Analysis for Single-Cell Graph Hub

## Classification
- **Type**: Data/ML Library (specialized package for bioinformatics research)
- **Deployment**: NPM/PyPI published package, Docker container
- **Maturity**: Alpha (core functionality sketched, API stabilizing, missing implementation)
- **Language**: Python (100% - ML/scientific computing focused)

## Purpose Statement
Single-Cell Graph Hub curates 200+ single-cell omics datasets as graph-structured data and provides PyTorch Geometric-based tools for applying Graph Neural Networks to biological discovery tasks like cell type prediction and trajectory inference.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive vision**: Well-defined scope targeting specific scientific domain
- **Mature documentation**: Extensive README with detailed API examples
- **Strong architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Scientific focus**: Addresses real biological analysis needs
- **Professional setup**: Complete SDLC infrastructure already in place (testing, CI/CD, security)
- **Industry standards**: Follows Python packaging best practices

### Gaps
- **Implementation missing**: Only skeleton code exists (`src/scgraph_hub/__init__.py` contains imports for non-existent modules)
- **Core modules absent**: `dataset.py`, `catalog.py`, and all other promised modules missing
- **No actual functionality**: Cannot be installed or used as documented
- **Missing data**: No sample datasets or preprocessing pipelines
- **Broken imports**: Package cannot be imported due to missing dependencies

### Recommendations
1. **P0 - Core Implementation**: Build the fundamental modules (`dataset.py`, `catalog.py`, basic models)
2. **P0 - Basic functionality**: Create minimal working example matching README
3. **P1 - Sample data**: Add small test datasets for development and examples
4. **P1 - API stabilization**: Align actual implementation with documented API
5. **P2 - Advanced features**: Implement specialized models and benchmarking tools

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical)
- Implement `SCGraphDataset` and `DatasetCatalog` classes
- Create basic graph construction utilities
- Add minimal model implementations
- Establish data loading and preprocessing pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Features (High)
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Implement sample datasets and loaders
- Create basic visualization tools
- Establish model training utilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium)
- Specialized GNN architectures
- Benchmarking and evaluation systems
- Integration with scanpy/seurat
- Pre-trained model zoo

## Key Success Metrics
- Package can be pip installed and imported without errors
- Basic workflow from README executes successfully
- Core API matches documented interface
- Test coverage >80% for implemented features
- At least one complete end-to-end example works
