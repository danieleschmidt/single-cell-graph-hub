# Architecture Overview

## System Design

Single-Cell Graph Hub is designed as a modular, extensible platform for graph-based single-cell omics analysis. The architecture follows a layered approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Layer
- **Dataset Loaders**: Unified interface for loading various single-cell formats (H5AD, H5, Zarr)
- **Graph Constructors**: Methods for building cell-cell relationship graphs
- **Data Processors**: Standardized preprocessing pipelines

### 2. Model Layer
- **Base Models**: Abstract classes defining common GNN interfaces
- **Specialized Models**: Task-specific implementations (CellGraphSAGE, SpatialGAT, etc.)
- **Model Zoo**: Pre-trained model repository with transfer learning capabilities

### 3. Evaluation Layer
- **Benchmarks**: Standardized evaluation protocols for various tasks
- **Metrics**: Biological and graph-specific evaluation metrics
- **Leaderboards**: Performance tracking and comparison systems

### 4. Visualization Layer
- **Interactive Plots**: Web-based graph exploration tools
- **Publication Figures**: High-quality, publication-ready visualizations
- **Integration Tools**: Seamless connection with existing single-cell packages

## Data Flow

```
Raw Data (H5AD/H5/Zarr) → Data Loader → Graph Constructor → Model Training → Evaluation → Visualization
                                    ↓
                               Preprocessor → Feature Engineering → Model Input
```
