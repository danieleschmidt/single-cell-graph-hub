# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a way to record the architectural decisions made for the Single-Cell Graph Hub project. This will help future contributors understand the reasoning behind design choices and provide a historical record of how the architecture evolved.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will be stored as a markdown file in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context for future contributors
- Improved maintainability and knowledge transfer
- Standardized format for decision documentation

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Need to maintain ADRs as architecture evolves

## Format
Each ADR will follow this template:
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: Background and problem statement
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: Expected outcomes, both positive and negative
