# ADR-0002: PyTorch Geometric as Graph Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Single-Cell Graph Hub requires a robust graph neural network framework to handle various graph-based operations on single-cell data. We need to choose between several options including PyTorch Geometric (PyG), Deep Graph Library (DGL), and TensorFlow-based solutions.

## Decision
We will use PyTorch Geometric (PyG) as our primary graph neural network framework.

## Rationale
- **Mature Ecosystem**: PyG has extensive support for various GNN architectures
- **Performance**: Optimized for large-scale graph operations
- **Community**: Large and active community with frequent updates
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with PyTorch ecosystem
- **Biological Applications**: Proven track record in computational biology
- **Memory Efficiency**: Built-in support for mini-batching and sparse operations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Access to state-of-the-art GNN implementations
- Efficient handling of large single-cell datasets
- Strong community support and documentation
- Easy integration with existing PyTorch models
- Built-in utilities for graph data handling

### Negative
- Learning curve for contributors unfamiliar with PyG
- Dependency on PyTorch ecosystem
- Potential limitations for non-graph operations

## Alternatives Considered
- **Deep Graph Library (DGL)**: Good performance but less mature ecosystem
- **TensorFlow-based solutions**: Would require additional dependencies
- **Custom implementation**: Too much development overhead
