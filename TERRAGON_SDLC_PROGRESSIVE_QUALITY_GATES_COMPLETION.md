## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

```python

class ProgressiveThreshold:
    base_value: float = 80.0
    current_level: ProgressiveLevel
    target_value: float = 95.0
    adaptation_rate: float = 0.1
    history: List[float] = []
    
    def get_current_threshold(self) -> float:
        # Adapts based on level + performance history
        base_threshold = self.base_value * level_multipliers[self.current_level]
        if self.history:
            recent_avg = sum(self.history[-10:]) / 10
            if recent_avg > base_threshold:
                base_threshold = min(base_threshold + self.adaptation_rate, self.target_value)
        return base_threshold
```

### Progressive Resilience Implementation
```python
# Self-healing orchestrator
class ProgressiveResilienceOrchestrator:
    async def execute_with_resilience(self, name: str, func: Callable) -> Any:
        # Apply rate limiting ‚Üí circuit breaker ‚Üí retry ‚Üí self-healing
        strategies_applied = []
        
        if ResilienceStrategy.RATE_LIMITING in self.enabled_strategies:
            if not self.rate_limiter.acquire():
                raise Exception("Rate limit exceeded")
                
        if ResilienceStrategy.CIRCUIT_BREAKER in self.enabled_strategies:
            circuit_breaker = self.get_circuit_breaker(name)
            result = await self.retry_handler.retry_async(
                circuit_breaker.call, func, *args, **kwargs
            )
        
        return result
```

### Progressive Scalability Framework
```python
# Intelligent load balancer
class ProgressiveLoadBalancer:
    def _adaptive_weighted_selection(self, workers, task) -> str:
        scores = {}
        for worker_id, worker in workers.items():
            load_score = worker.calculate_load_score()
            capacity_bonus = worker.capacity_score
            workload_bonus = self._calculate_workload_affinity(worker, task.workload_type)
            perf_bonus = self._get_performance_bonus(worker_id, task.function.__name__)
            
            combined_score = load_score - (capacity_bonus + workload_bonus + perf_bonus) * 0.1
            scores[worker_id] = max(0.01, combined_score)
        
        # Weighted random selection (inverse probability)
        return self._weighted_selection(scores)
